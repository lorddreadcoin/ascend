- Flat gold color (#FFD700 only)
- White backgrounds
- Static design
- Basic hover effects
- Simple gradients

---

## 🎨 COLOR TRANSFORMATION

### BEFORE:
```
Gold: #FFD700 (flat, single tone)
Background: #ffffff (white)
Cards: #ffffff (white)
Sections: #f8f8f8 (off-white)
```

### AFTER:
```
Gold Royal: #FFD700 (highlights)
Gold Metallic: #D4AF37 (transitions)
Gold Antique: #B8860B (depth)
Background: #0a0a0a (matte black)
Cards: #1a1a1a → #0a0a0a (dark gradient)
Sections: #0d0d0d (textured black)
```

**Why:** Three gold variants create shimmer effect like real metallic surfaces. Matte black makes gold pop 10x harder and feels luxury (think Lamborghini, Rolex, high-end fashion sites).

## 🎯 VISUAL HIERARCHY SHIFT

Ambient: Background
```

### AFTER:
```
Primary Focus: Hero + CTAs (brightest, most motion)
Secondary: Section headings (metallic shine)

Ambient: Particles, parallax, texture
```

**Result:** Eye naturally flows to conversion points (CTAs, featured pricing)

---

## 💎 DEPTH LAYERS CREATED

```
Layer 1: Content
Layer 2: Background
```

Layer 4: Ambient glow (slowest)
Layer 5: Matte texture (fixed)
```

**Result:** Site feels like you're looking INTO it, not AT it

Drip effects
Particle emissions
```

**Result:** Gold looks METALLIC, not painted. Like real jewelry catching light.
